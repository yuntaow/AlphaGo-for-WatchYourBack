# implement-alphaGo-in-watchyourback

Many thanks to Siraj Raval and the author of the repository(https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general). Thanks for their inspirations. I finally take my courage to learn and implement the Alphazero. 

This repository is based on https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general.

My agent successfully learns to play the game by himself. Although it takes a long, long time for the algorithm to understand the game entirely, I am so impressed by how smart an algorithm can be.
